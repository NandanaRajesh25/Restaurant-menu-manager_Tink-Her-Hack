Project Description 
The Restaurant Menu Manager is a web-based application that allows restaurant managers to easily add, edit, and manage menu items. It offers a user-friendly interface for updating menu details like names, descriptions, prices, and images. 

 
The Problem Statement 
Managing a restaurant menu can be time-consuming, especially if the menu changes frequently. Restaurant owners struggle with creating a fast, easy way to update and organize their menus while keeping everything synced across their locations. 

 

The Solution 
We created an intuitive, responsive web app that allows restaurant managers to easily add new menu items, categorize them, and update prices. The solution minimizes manual work and makes menu management simple, all with just a few clicks!
